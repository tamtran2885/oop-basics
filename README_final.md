### Concepts

1. What is object-oriented programming in general terms ?

Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic. OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them.

2. What is a class?

Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods. Basic class definitions begin with the keyword class, followed by a class name, followed by a pair of curly braces which enclose the definitions of the properties and methods belonging to the class.
